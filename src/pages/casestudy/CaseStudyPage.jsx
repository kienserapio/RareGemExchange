            They came to us needing more than a website. They needed a digital presence that
            behaves like a private bank rather than a shop: high-trust, evidence-heavy, and quietly
            persuasive — and, behind it, a way to actually capture and act on the handful of serious
            buyers a brand like this lives on. We designed and built the whole system: brand
            expression, marketing site, catalog, concierge, and the operations layer that ties it
            together.

            This market runs on trust, provenance, and discretion — not discounts or urgency. Rare

              We started from the buyer’s world, not from web trends. The reference points were
              private banking, auction-house catalogues, museum labels, and Swiss gem-lab reports —
              places where restraint signals seriousness. Retail e-commerce patterns (bright,

              That led to a single organising idea: the site should feel like a vault at night,
              where the stones are the only source of colour. Everything downstream — the
              near-black canvas, the one gold accent, the engraved type, the atmospheric
              gradients — follows from that image.

              A single dark mineral photograph sits <em>fixed</em> behind the entire site, dimmed by
              a <code>rgba(5,5,5,0.72)</code> scrim. Fixed position means content floats over a
              stable, deep backdrop as you scroll — a subterranean, vault-like calm rather than a
              busy hero image. The scrim is doing the real work: it pushes the photograph back into
              atmosphere so it never competes with the stones or the type.

            <p className="csp-body">
              Over that base we layer <em>gradients as lighting</em>, not decoration. Warm radial

              one gold bar is the only place colour ever runs edge to edge. Every value is
